/**
 * What a terminal bell (BEL, `\x07`) does (#335).
 *
 * Since #53 every bell raised a full notification — OS toast,
 * chime, taskbar flash — because in-pane agents ring it when they wait on a
 * human. But shells ring it as TYPING feedback: Backspace on an empty line,
 * Left at column 0, Tab with no completion. In the pane being typed in, that
 * made a slip of the finger pop a toast and play the chime, and the usual
 * answer was to set the sound to None, which also silenced the alerts the
 * notification exists for.
 *
 * So the bell is split by whether the user can SEE the pane: on-screen it is
 * local feedback only (the `bellStyle` pref), off-screen it is the #53
 * notification (gated by `bellNotify`). `visible` is the prop PaneWrapper
 * already computes — active tab AND active workspace — so a background tab and
 * an inactive workspace are both off-screen; `windowFocused` covers wmux being
 * minimised or behind another app. A visible pane WITHOUT keyboard focus (the
 * other half of a split) counts as on-screen on purpose: the user can see it,
 * and the default visual flash is the cue an agent ringing there needs.
 *
 * Pure, because the interesting part is the decision and the driver lives in
 * a hook that needs a real xterm to reach.
