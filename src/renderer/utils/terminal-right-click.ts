/**
 * What a right-click inside a terminal does (#336).
 *
 * It used to do nothing: no `contextmenu` handler existed and Electron shows
 * no default menu. On Windows it is THE terminal clipboard gesture — conhost
 * QuickEdit, Windows Terminal, PuTTY and mintty all use it — so the default
 * mirrors Windows Terminal: copy the selection if there is one, else paste.
 * That is also what wmux's own Ctrl+C already does with a selection.
 *
 * An app that turned on mouse tracking (vim `mouse=a`, tmux, htop, opencode)
 * owns the click: xterm has already sent it the right-button report on
 * mousedown, and pasting on top of that would type the clipboard into an app
 * that just acted on the click. Shift is the bypass every terminal uses, and
 * on Windows it costs nothing here: xterm's `shouldForceSelection` is
 * `shiftKey`, so with Shift held no report is sent and the gesture is ours.
 *
 * Pure, because the decision is the part worth pinning and the driver lives in
 * a hook that needs a real xterm to reach.
