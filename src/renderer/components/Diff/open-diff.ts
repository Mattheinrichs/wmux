/**
 * "Show me these changes" from the file explorer (#325) — the one implementation.
 *
 * The explorer and the Diff tab read the SAME provider (`diff-provider.ts`),
 * but until now nothing on screen connected them: the explorer printed
 * `8 changed +37 -18 vs HEAD` and the only way to see those lines was to know
 * Ctrl+Shift+G. This module is the connection.
 *
 * A Diff tab normally follows the workspace cwd, which is last-reporter-wins
 * across every pane. The explorer's root is the FOCUSED pane's terminal, so
 * with two panes in two repos the shortcut's tab could show the other one. A
 * tab opened from here is therefore pinned to the explorer's root through
 * `SurfaceRef.cwd` (persisted like any other cwd), and a later click reuses
 * a tab already looking at that root instead of stacking a second one.
 *
 * Selecting a file is not state worth persisting — it is a one-shot request to
 * a component that may not be mounted yet — so it travels through a pending
 * map plus a window event rather than through the store.
